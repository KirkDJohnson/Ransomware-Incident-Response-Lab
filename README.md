<h1>Ransomware Incident Response Lab IN PROGRESS</h1>



<h2>Description</h2> In this lab/CTF, my task was to investigate an exchange server that the admins could not connect to and a weird file on thier drive. I nthe scernio the ransomnote was shown as part of the setup so it was initally clear that the ransomware Conti was invovled in the incident. Intrestingly, this lab walk-through provided a considerable amount of tools to analyze the incident such as logs Splunk, a packet capture from wireshark, and a Redline image of the effected system. Due to me having experinece using Splunk and Wireshark, I wanted to take the time and learn Redline so I tried to uncover as much I could with it before eventually pivoting to the Splunk logs to finish finding the indicaotrs of compormise. So the first thing I did was open the .mans with Redline and begun conduciting basic traiging such as finding out the Operating System and quickly came accross a potenteial suspicious user named "securityninja".
